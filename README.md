To complete my analysis and create the final infographic, I used a combination of R, Python, Excel, and Illustrator. I began by using the MET API to request data through Python for each of the three art movements I wanted to analyze. I then used R to visualize the data and create charts and graphs that highlighted the similarities and differences between the movements. I repeated this process three times for each art movement. Finally, I used Illustrator to create the infographic, which brought together all of the visualizations I created in R and presented them in a clear and concise manner. By using multiple software tools, I was able to collect and analyze data effectively, and create an impactful infographic that conveyed my findings in an engaging way.
